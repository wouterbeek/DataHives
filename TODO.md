Cleanup
-------

  [ ] Clean up legacy modules.
  [ ] Update most of the test modules.
      These are mostly specific configurations of
      populations / collections of agents.
      Maybe build an architecture for defining and running
      population specifications?


Communication
-------------

  [ ] Ants leave pheromons.


Visualization
-------------

  [ ] Display the paths of agents in the GraphViz-generated SVG,
      using a different color for each agent.
